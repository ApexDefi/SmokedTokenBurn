# Smoked Token Burn

This GitHub Repository contains the Whitepaper & Contracts for $BURN - a hyper deflationary token with automatic burn and redistribution mechanism

## The Problem

The current traditional token lacks sustainable value retention, fair distribution, and community engagement within cryptocurrency ecosystems.

1. **Inflationary Pressures:** Many fiat currencies and some cryptocurrencies experience inflation over time, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. Hyper-deflationary tokens counteract this by implementing mechanisms that reduce the token supply over time, thereby potentially increasing the value of each token.

2. **Lack of Token Utility:** Some cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic value or utility beyond speculative trading. Hyper-deflationary tokens incentivize holding by implementing features such as automatic burn and redistribution, which can reward holders and contribute to the token's ecosystem.
3. **Tokenomics Stability:** Traditional tokens may suffer from volatility due to speculative trading, market manipulation, or lack of inherent value. By introducing mechanisms like automatic burn and redistribution, hyper-deflationary tokens aim to create a more stable tokenomics model that incentivizes long-term holding and discourages short-term speculation.
4. **Fair Distribution:** In some cases, initial token distributions may heavily favor early adopters or insiders, leading to centralization of wealth. Hyper-deflationary tokens can incorporate redistribution mechanisms that distribute tokens to all holders, promoting a more equitable distribution of wealth within the token ecosystem.
5. **Community Engagement:** Traditional tokens may struggle to maintain community engagement beyond initial token sales. Hyper-deflationary tokens can foster a sense of community ownership and participation through features like redistribution, incentivizing active participation and engagement among token holders.

## The Solution - $BURN

The $BURN project is designed to combat inflation, enhance token utility, stabilize tokenomics, promote fair distribution, and foster community engagement within cryptocurrency ecosystems.

### Tokenomics

There will be a fixed total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. 50% of the supply will be launched in the Uniswap V2 liquidity pool to promote fair launch. Remaining 49% will be burned!!! 1% will be used for giveaways.

### Tax Structure

#### Initial Tax Rates

A 15% tax will be applied to both buy and sell transactions for the first 50 transactions.

This tax will be split as follows:
- 1% Redistribution to Current Holders
- 1% Token Burn
- 13% Marketing Wallet

#### Transition to 3/3 Tax Structure:
After the first 50 transactions, the tax structure will automatically switch to a 3/3 tax model.

Under this model, a 3% tax will be applied to both buy and sell transactions.

This tax will be split equally as follows:
- 1% Redistribution to Current Holders
- 1% Token Burn
- 1% Marketing Wallet

### Anti-whale Mechanism
To promote longevity and fair distribution, we will tax 15% on any buy equal or greater than 1% (10,000,000 $BURN) of the total supply and tax 50% on any sell equal or greater than 1% (10,000,000 $BURN) of the total supply. There will be 30% tax on any sell equal or greater than .5% (5,000,000 $BURN) of the total supply.
