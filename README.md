# Smoked Token Burn

Introducing $BURN - A Revolutionary Hyper Deflationary Token

## The Problem

Cryptocurrency ecosystems often struggle with value retention, fair distribution, and community engagement. Traditional tokens face issues like inflation, lack of utility, and volatile tokenomics.

1. **Inflationary Pressures:** Many fiat currencies and some cryptocurrencies experience inflation over time, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. Hyper-deflationary tokens counteract this by implementing mechanisms that reduce the token supply over time, thereby potentially increasing the value of each token.

2. **Lack of Token Utility:** Some cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic value or utility beyond speculative trading. Hyper-deflationary tokens incentivize holding by implementing features such as automatic burn and redistribution, which can reward holders and contribute to the token's ecosystem.
3. **Tokenomics Stability:** Traditional tokens may suffer from volatility due to speculative trading, market manipulation, or lack of inherent value. By introducing mechanisms like automatic burn and redistribution, hyper-deflationary tokens aim to create a more stable tokenomics model that incentivizes long-term holding and discourages short-term speculation.
4. **Fair Distribution:** In some cases, initial token distributions may heavily favor early adopters or insiders, leading to centralization of wealth. Hyper-deflationary tokens can incorporate redistribution mechanisms that distribute tokens to all holders, promoting a more equitable distribution of wealth within the token ecosystem.
5. **Community Engagement:** Traditional tokens may struggle to maintain community engagement beyond initial token sales. Hyper-deflationary tokens can foster a sense of community ownership and participation through features like redistribution, incentivizing active participation and engagement among token holders.

## The Solution

$BURN aims to solve these problems by implementing automatic burn and redistribution mechanisms. This approach increases token value and incentivizes long-term holding, while promoting a more equitable distribution of wealth.

### Tokenomics

$BURN has a fixed total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. 69% will be launched in the Uniswap V2 liquidity pool to ensure a fair launch. The remaining 31% will be used for marketing, community, and other exchanges.

### Tax Structure

#### Initial Tax Rates

For the first 25/50 transactions, a 15% tax will be applied to both buy and sell transactions. This will be split as follows:
1.5% Redistribution to Current Holders (including the burn wallet for automatic burn)
13.5% Marketing Wallet

#### Transition to 3/3 Tax Structure:
After the first 50 transactions, the tax structure will transition to a 3/3 model, with a 3% tax on both buy and sell transactions. The 1.5% redistribution and 1.5% marketing wallet split remains.

### Anti-whale Mechanism
To ensure fair distribution, a 16% tax will be applied to any buy/sell equal or greater than .9% (9,000,000 $BURN) of the total supply.

$BURN's mission is to revolutionize the cryptocurrency landscape by addressing inflation, token utility, and tokenomics stability. By fostering a strong community and promoting fair distribution, $BURN is set to become a game-changer in the world of digital currency.
